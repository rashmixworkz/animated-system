java is platform independant language.Byte code can run in any platform so byte code is called as platform indepandent.
compiler converts java program into byte code that byte code can run in any os.
bytecode is intermideate code that understand only jvm and jvm run the bytecode in any os.

primitive datatype                                            non-primitive datatype

there are 8 primitives datatypes                             there are n number of datatypes

primitive datatypes does not have states & behaviours         non-primitive datatypes have states & behaviours

ex: int,byte                                                   ex: arrays,String

class classname
{
	class members;
}

class is templet or blueprint of objects.
class members are variables which is used to store the valve and declared within class.

ex:

class Student
{
	String name;
	int RollNumber;
	String section;
}

class Percentage
{
  static double totalMarks;
  static double receivedMarks;
  static double percentage;
  
 static double student(String[] marks)
{
    System.out.println("start");
	totalMarks=(receivedMarks/totalMarks)*100;
	return percentage;
   System.out.println("end");
} 
}
class PercentageRunner
{

public static void main(String[] args)
{
	System.out.println("main method start");
	Percentage.student(590,625);
	System.out.println("main method end");
	
}
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
	
}
public is access specifier;static is non-access specifier;void is return type;main is name of the method;
()paranthesis; string[] args is parameters;{} is body;

main method excutes in stack memory.
